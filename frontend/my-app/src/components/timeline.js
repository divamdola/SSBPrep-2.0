                In <strong>Picture Perception (PP)</strong>, an image is
                displayed on the screen for a period of 30 seconds, then 1
                minute is given to the candidates to fill in the details, and in
                the next 4 minutes, they are required to write a story around
                it. Candidates need to be very observant and note down minute
                details about the picture and its characters like the mood, age,
                actions, etc. The story written by the candidates should not
                just define the picture but relate to the picture as well.

              <p>
                In the <strong>Discussion Test (DT)</strong>, candidates are

              <p>
                The Personal Interview is one of the most important parts of the
                SSB Interview. Candidates have a one-to-one interview with the
                Interviewing Officer (IO). It starts on day 2 of the SSB.
                Candidates are questioned on their daily activities, their own
                performance, and some general awareness questions. Candidates
                need to be very careful while answering the questions as the IO
                judge their body language, facial expressions, alertness, their
                answers, speaking skills, etc and this is a key factor in the
                selection of the candidates.

              <p>
                On the final day of the 5 days, SSB interview procedure
                candidates have to appear for the final test i.e., the Board
                Conference Day. Candidates have to face a panel of officers who
                assess the candidate on various parameters like their
                personality, presence of mind, performance in the SSB tasks,
                etc. Certain questions about the stay of the candidate, their
                performance, their equation with their fellow batchmates, etc
                are asked and the panel takes a collective decision. Borderline
                candidates can be asked certain situation-based questions and
                then the final decision is made.{" "}

                The results are announced and candidates who can satisfy the
                criteria laid out by the board are recommended and those who
                miss their chance of being selected are sent back home to
                prepare themselves for the next time.
